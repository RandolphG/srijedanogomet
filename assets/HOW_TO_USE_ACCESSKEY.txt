The accesskey global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element.
The attribute value must consist of a single printable character (which includes accented and other characters that can be generated by the keyboard).

Accessibility concerns
In addition to poor browser support, there are numerous concerns with the accesskey attribute:

An accesskey value can conflict with a system or browser keyboard shortcut, or assistive technology functionality.
What may work for one combination of operating system, assistive technology, and browser may not work with other combinations.
Certain accesskey values may not be present on certain keyboards, especially when internationalization is a concern. So adapting to
specific languages could cause further problems. accesskey values that rely on numbers may be confusing to individuals experiencing
cognitive concerns, where the number doesn't have a logical association with the functionality it triggers.
Informing the user that accesskeys are present, so that they are aware of the functionality. If the system lacks a method of notifying
the user about this feature, the user might accidentally activate accesskeys.
Because of these issues, it is generally advised not to use accesskeys for most general-purpose websites and web apps.
